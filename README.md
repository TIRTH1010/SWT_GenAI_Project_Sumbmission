# JSON Querying with Web Scraping and LangChain in Python

This repository contains Python code for performing JSON querying through web scraping, as well as setting up a Python environment using Conda. It also demonstrates the usage of LangChain, a library for natural language processing tasks.

## JSON Querying by Web Scraping

The Python script in this repository demonstrates how to perform JSON querying by scraping data from a website using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. The scraping process involves sending a GET request to a specified URL, parsing the HTML content, and extracting the desired data.

## Setting up Python Environment in Conda

The repository provides instructions for setting up a Python environment using Conda. Conda is a package manager and environment management system that helps manage dependencies and create isolated environments for Python projects.

## Usage of LangChain

The code also showcases the usage of LangChain, a library for natural language processing tasks. It demonstrates the following functionalities:
- Importing modules from LangChain, such as `RetrievalQA`, `TextL
